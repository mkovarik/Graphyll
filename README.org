* Graphyll

Graphyll is a static site generator. Or rather, it is a tool that static
site generators can use to be fast and efficient.

The usage is pretty simple. One writes (either manually or with a
script) a TOML file containing a list of interdependent tasks. Calling
Graphyll on such a file executes its tasks in topological order.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ graphyll task_list.toml
#+END_SRC

Graphyll should be used for incremental builds. This means tasks are
only executed if relevant changes have been made. This can provide
significant performance boosts for most workflows.

Enabling such incremental builds requires a cached TOML file from which
to be read and (optionally) a cached TOML file from which to be written.
They are usually the same file.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ graphyll task_list.toml -r cache.toml -w cache.toml
#+END_SRC
